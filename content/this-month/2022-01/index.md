## Project Updates

In this section, we give an overview of notable changes to the projects hosted under the [`rust-osdev`] organization.

[`rust-osdev`]: https://github.com/rust-osdev/about

### [`x86_64`](https://github.com/rust-osdev/x86_64)

The `x86_64` crate provides various abstractions for `x86_64` systems, including wrappers for CPU instructions, access to processor-specific registers, and abstraction types for architecture-specific structures such as page tables and descriptor tables.

In January, â€¦

### [`multiboot2`](https://github.com/rust-osdev/multiboot2)

The `multiboot2` crate provides abstraction types for the boot information of multiboot2 bootloaders.
The latest release of the `multiboot2`-crate is now `v.0.13.1` (was `v0.12.2`). It contains minor improvements,
such as new getters that were originally missing.

The combined diff of all changes can be found [here](https://github.com/rust-osdev/multiboot2/compare/multiboot2-header-v0.1.0...multiboot2-v0.13.1).

## Other Projects

In this section, we describe updates to Rust OS projects that are not directly related to the `rust-osdev` organization. Feel free to [create a pull request](https://github.com/rust-osdev/homepage/pulls) with the updates of your OS project for the next post.

### [`ntfs`](https://github.com/ColinFinck/ntfs)

<span class="gray">(Section written by [@ColinFinck](https://github.com/ColinFinck))</span>

Colin Finck released an initial version of his [ntfs](https://github.com/ColinFinck/ntfs) crate this month, a Rust library to access Microsoft's proprietary NTFS filesystem.

For those of you who are not running Windows:
NTFS is the primary filesystem in Windows, from Windows NT's release in 1993 up to the current Windows 11.
Unlike FAT32, NTFS has no practical limits for file and partition sizes, comes with B-Tree Indexes for faster lookups, and adds a few resilience and efficiency features (such as journaling, compression, and sparse files). 

The ntfs crate supports Rust's no_std environment and is therefore not tied to a specific platform API.
It aims to be embeddable in firmware-level code and kernels just as well as in user-mode applications.

Colin Finck will [talk about NTFS](https://fosdem.org/2022/schedule/event/misc_ntfs_rust/) and his adventures in writing a filesystem crate in Rust on the upcoming FOSDEM conference.
The talk is on Saturday, 5 February at 17:00 (CET, UTC+1).
The conference is virtual and admission is free.
