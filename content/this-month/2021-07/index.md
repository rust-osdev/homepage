### [`uefi-rs`](https://github.com/rust-osdev/uefi-rs)

The `uefi` crate provides safe and performant wrappers for [UEFI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unified_Extensible_Firmware_Interface), the successor to the BIOS. In July, we merged the following changes:

- [Add support for getting/setting variables](https://github.com/rust-osdev/uefi-rs/pull/245)

- [device path: change the length type to u16](https://github.com/rust-osdev/uefi-rs/pull/251)
- [Implement `BootServices::protocols_per_handle`](https://github.com/rust-osdev/uefi-rs/pull/253)
- [Add method to get variable names](https://github.com/rust-osdev/uefi-rs/pull/254)
- [Better `fmt::Debug` for `Time` struct + `fmt::Display`](https://github.com/rust-osdev/uefi-rs/pull/256)
