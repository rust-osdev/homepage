## Project Updates

In this section, we give an overview of notable changes to the projects hosted under the [`rust-osdev`] organization.

[`rust-osdev`]: https://github.com/rust-osdev/about

### [`uefi-rs`](https://github.com/rust-osdev/uefi-rs)

The `uefi` crate provides safe and performant wrappers for [UEFI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unified_Extensible_Firmware_Interface), the successor to the BIOS. In July, we merged the following changes:

- [Add support for getting/setting variables](https://github.com/rust-osdev/uefi-rs/pull/245)
- [Better logger that includes filename and line](https://github.com/rust-osdev/uefi-rs/pull/246)
- [device path: add constants for all subtypes](https://github.com/rust-osdev/uefi-rs/pull/250)
- [device path: change the length type to u16](https://github.com/rust-osdev/uefi-rs/pull/251)
- [Implement `BootServices::protocols_per_handle`](https://github.com/rust-osdev/uefi-rs/pull/253)
- [Add method to get variable names](https://github.com/rust-osdev/uefi-rs/pull/254)
- [Better `fmt::Debug` for `Time` struct + `fmt::Display`](https://github.com/rust-osdev/uefi-rs/pull/256)
- [Fix `BltRegion::Full` bounds check](https://github.com/rust-osdev/uefi-rs/pull/257)
- [Fix procedural macros](https://github.com/rust-osdev/uefi-rs/pull/260)
- [device path: add header struct](https://github.com/rust-osdev/uefi-rs/pull/263)
- [device path: add iter method and test](https://github.com/rust-osdev/uefi-rs/pull/264)

### [`acpi`](https://github.com/rust-osdev/acpi)

The `acpi` repository contains crates for parsing the ACPI tables – data structures that the firmware of modern computers use to relay information about the hardware to the OS.
This month:

- [Definitions were added for the FADT's fixed and architecture flags](https://github.com/rust-osdev/acpi/pull/103)
- [Table signatures were added for more static tables](https://github.com/rust-osdev/acpi/pull/103)
- [AML: support was added for the `DefPowerResource` opcode](https://github.com/rust-osdev/acpi/commit/7f6bb2ee53c9abb6c552434dbdb4e13cf38b6b26)
- [AML: support was added for the `DefThermalZone` opcode](https://github.com/rust-osdev/acpi/commit/a55d82bad3e5b7ffd42d19487a57ca65359e3bad)
- [AML: support was added for the `DefExternal` opcode](https://github.com/rust-osdev/acpi/commit/188d62fdab853c16e9c3e66bb183acc3e1c9f134)
- [AML: support was added for the `DefConcat` opcode](https://github.com/rust-osdev/acpi/commit/6f92f675a4b0e21a5bc63edd99de1010efdb61fa)
- [AML: support was added for the `DefConcatRes` opcode](https://github.com/rust-osdev/acpi/commit/a883868dd57473a61a095c56d3e7490dfe012700)
- [AML: support was added for the `DefMid` opcode](https://github.com/rust-osdev/acpi/commit/a37008df127c6f2160c1a2ac3ba5f536f8616732)

These changes were published as `acpi v3.1.0` and `aml v0.14.0`. Thanks to [@ethindp](https://github.com/ethindp)
and [@toku-sa-n](https://github.com/toku-sa-n) for their contributions.

### [`x86_64`](https://github.com/rust-osdev/x86_64)

The `x86_64` crate provides various abstractions for `x86_64` systems, including wrappers for CPU instructions, access to processor-specific registers, and abstraction types for architecture-specific structures such as page tables and descriptor tables.

In July, …
