## Other Projects

In this section, we describe updates to Rust OS projects that are not directly related to the `rust-osdev` organization. Feel free to [create a pull request](https://github.com/rust-osdev/homepage/pulls) with the updates of your OS project for the next post.

### [`SFBdragon/talc`](https://github.com/SFBdragon/talc)
<span class="maintainers">(Section written by [@SFBdragon](https://github.com/SFBdragon))</span>

`Talc` is a recently published, fast, and flexible `no-std` memory allocator. 
* It's the fastest allocator I've tested as of yet (galloc falls short, buddy_alloc is close but lacks heap efficiency).
* It features a OOM-handling component with dynamic arena resizing.

By the time you're seeing this, hopefully v2 should be out or coming soon:
* The OOM handler system has been made more powerful.
* `lock_api` is used to allow for custom allocator synchronization.
* The internals and API has been improved to pass miri's stacked borrows validation.
* You can now move the allocator struct around freely.
* And more :3

I hope you find it useful!

### [`vinc/moros`](https://github.com/vinc/moros)
<span class="maintainers">(Section written by [@vinc](https://github.com/vinc))</span>

[MOROS](http://moros.cc) is a text-based hobby operating system targeting computers with a x86-64 architecture and a BIOS.

Since last month's [release](https://github.com/vinc/moros/releases/tag/v0.10.0), I focused on adding new syscalls to interact with [network sockets](https://github.com/vinc/moros/pull/512) from userspace. The DNS and HTTP clients are now using the new UDP and TCP sockets.

I also added another syscall to poll multiple handles at the same time, to read from the console and a socket, improving the main network tool that can now be used as a simple chat program.

The VGA driver, the filesystem, and the editor got a few significant [improvements](https://github.com/vinc/moros/blob/trunk/CHANGELOG.md) as well, to support downloading and reading larger files.

### [`valibali/cluu`](https://github.com/valibali/cluu)
<span class="maintainers">(Section written by [@phil-opp](https://github.com/phil-opp))</span>

There is a new project featured in our [Showcase](@/showcase/_index.md) series:

- [**CLUU (Compact Lightweight Unix Utopia)**](@/showcase/cluu/index.md) by [@valibali](https://github.com/valibali)
