## Project Updates

In this section, we give an overview of notable changes to the projects hosted under the [`rust-osdev`] organization.

[`rust-osdev`]: https://github.com/rust-osdev/about

### [`x86_64`](https://github.com/rust-osdev/x86_64)

The `x86_64` crate provides various abstractions for `x86_64` systems, including wrappers for CPU instructions, access to processor-specific registers, and abstraction types for architecture-specific structures such as page tables and descriptor tables.

In February, â€¦

## Personal Projects

In this section, we describe updates to personal projects that are not directly related to the `rust-osdev` organization. Feel free to [create a pull request](https://github.com/rust-osdev/homepage/pulls) with the updates of your OS project for the next post.

I have been working on an OS following along with @phil-opp's tutorial series for a while, but recently decided I would rework my OS based on the first edition of the blog (since I preferred to use GRUB as my bootloader). This is the first progress I have to share on CelOS, and indeed the first time I've published one of these updates in general.

In February, I made a lot of great progress on CelOS. I have the complete physical memory (plus the framebuffer provided by GRUB) mapped to virtual memory, and a pixel-based framebuffer working with text output. Things are not very optimized right now (for one thing I'm stretching the `font8x8` font into 8x12), but this is a great first step that I can build on. Next planned steps are:

* Move the kernel in virtual memory so that it occupies the higher half of the 48-bit address space
* Create some page fault interrupt handling so that the kernel can at least attempt to handle page faults (rather than triple faulting as it does now)
* Set up memory allocation for the kernel, to get heap allocation
* Once heap allocation is in place, utilize some existing crate to handle TrueType fonts so that text will look a bit nicer on screen

I probably won't get all of that done in March, but those are my planned next steps. Thanks to this great community and to @phil-opp for being so helpful in the osdev journey!
