## News and Blog Posts

We try to collect posts that are relevant to Rust-based OS development each month. Please create pull requests for any posts that you want linked in the next issue.


## Project Updates

In this section, we give an overview of notable changes to the projects hosted under the [`rust-osdev`] organization.

[`rust-osdev`]: https://github.com/rust-osdev/about

### `uefi`

The [`uefi` crate](https://github.com/rust-osdev/uefi-rs) provides abstractions for the [`UEFI`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unified_Extensible_Firmware_Interface) standard that replaces the traditional BIOS on modern systems. This month, the crate's dependencies were updated, and a bug was fixed in the graphics protocol:

- [Bump x86_64 dependency version to fix build on latest nightlies](https://github.com/rust-osdev/uefi-rs/pull/134)
- [Fix `BltPixel::from` conversion](https://github.com/rust-osdev/uefi-rs/pull/135)

## New Projects

There are a number of new projects in the `rust-osdev` organization:


## Personal Projects

In this section, we describe updates to personal projects that are not directly related to the `rust-osdev` organization. Feel free to [create a pull request](https://github.com/rust-osdev/homepage/pulls) with the updates of your OS project for the next post.

### [`RustyHermit`](https://github.com/hermitcore/libhermit-rs)

RustyHermit is a [unikernel](http://unikernel.org) targeting a scalable and predictable runtime. Unikernel means, you bundle your application directly with the kernel library, so that it can run without any installed operating system.
This reduces image size and overhead, therefore, interesting applications include virtual machines and high-performance computing.

This month the integration of [smoltcp](https://github.com/smoltcp-rs/smoltcp) has been improved and first support for virtio has been integrated. The integration in Rust's standard runtime is already in progress and clients can be developed with `TcpStream`. Server side applications will follow soon.
