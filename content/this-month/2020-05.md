We try to collect posts that are relevant to Rust-based OS development each month. Please create pull requests for any posts that you want linked in the next issue.


## Project Updates

In this section, we give an overview of notable changes to the projects hosted under the [`rust-osdev`] organization.

[`rust-osdev`]: https://github.com/rust-osdev/about

### `uefi`

The [`uefi` crate](https://github.com/rust-osdev/uefi-rs) provides abstractions for the [`UEFI`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unified_Extensible_Firmware_Interface) standard that replaces the traditional BIOS on modern systems. This month, the crate's dependencies were updated, and a bug was fixed in the graphics protocol:

- [Bump x86_64 dependency version to fix build on latest nightlies](https://github.com/rust-osdev/uefi-rs/pull/134)
- [Fix `BltPixel::from` conversion](https://github.com/rust-osdev/uefi-rs/pull/135)

### [`acpi`](https://github.com/rust-osdev/acpi)
The `acpi` repository contains crates for parsing the ACPI tables – data structures that the firmware of modern
computers use to relay information about the hardware to the OS. Not a lot happened this month, but preparations
were made to change how the AML namespace is stored on the heap, in order to avoid a lot of small heap allocations
for AML paths, and reduce the number of heap allocations overall. However, some more profiling infrastructure will
need to be built before starting this.

In preparation, a [change to how `DefName`s are stored in the namespace](https://github.com/rust-osdev/acpi/commit/3b08721981d85e7bd82124db8c72e0c31d243771) was made, which avoids an extra heap
allocation per `DefName`, and also allows us to simplify some code around the `aml` crate.

## New Projects

There are a number of new projects in the `rust-osdev` organization:


## Personal Projects

In this section, we describe updates to personal projects that are not directly related to the `rust-osdev` organization. Feel free to [create a pull request](https://github.com/rust-osdev/homepage/pulls) with the updates of your OS project for the next post.

### [`IsaacWoods/pebble`](https://github.com/IsaacWoods/pebble)
This month, I've been tracking down a bug in the kernel that causes usermode stacks to become corrupted on the
return of some system calls. While I've not found the root cause, I've taken this opportunity to add some more
debugging capabilities, which have found a number of other kernel bugs.

I also started working on the Rust implementation of [Ptah](https://github.com/IsaacWoods/pebble/tree/master/lib/ptah/src),
the wire format for Pebble's message passing interface. It allows libraries to easily use [Serde](https://serde.rs/) to
serialize and deserialize Rust types to and from the wire format. In the future, a compiler will be able to
generate bindings for `Ptah` for a number of different supported languages, which will allow tasks written in
different languages to communicate over Pebble `Channel`s using idiomatic types.


### [`rust-embedded/rust-raspberrypi-OS-tutorials`](https://github.com/rust-embedded/rust-raspberrypi-OS-tutorials)

<span class="gray">(Section written by [@andre-richter](https://github.com/andre-richter))</span>

May was a quiet month for the project, since I am currently taking a little hiatus. I am planning to restart working on new content two or three months down the road.

Therefore, only some maintenance updates went in, e.g. bumping all dependency crates to versions that support the new `llvm_asm!` macros. Also, the chinese translations received updates/additions ([main Readme ](https://github.com/rust-embedded/rust-raspberrypi-OS-tutorials/blob/master/README.CN.md); [00_before_we_start](https://github.com/rust-embedded/rust-raspberrypi-OS-tutorials/blob/master/00_before_we_start/README.CN.md)).
