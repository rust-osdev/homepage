## Project Updates

In this section, we give an overview of notable changes to the projects hosted under the [`rust-osdev`] organization.

[`rust-osdev`]: https://github.com/rust-osdev/about

### [`x86_64`](https://github.com/rust-osdev/x86_64)

The `x86_64` crate provides various abstractions for `x86_64` systems, including wrappers for CPU instructions, access to processor-specific registers, and abstraction types for architecture-specific structures such as page tables and descriptor tables.

In July, …

### [`spinning_top`](https://github.com/rust-osdev/spinning_top)

The `spinning_top` crate provides a simple spinlock implementation based on the abstractions of the [`lock_api`](https://docs.rs/lock_api/0.4.1/lock_api/) crate. We created the crate to provide an alternative to the no-longer maintained [`spin`](https://github.com/mvdnes/spin-rs) crate.

This month, …

### [`uefi-rs`](https://github.com/rust-osdev/uefi-rs)

The `uefi-rs` crate provides safe and performant wrappers for [UEFI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unified_Extensible_Firmware_Interface), the successor to the BIOS.

The major changes which happened in this month are:
- We've tested out support for AArch64. No updates to the code are needed, just [add a custom target file](https://github.com/rust-osdev/uefi-rs/blob/e2748687bdafcc21f35e6d4db27b4b1b31bdcf6e/uefi-test-runner/aarch64-unknown-uefi.json) for 64-bit ARM UEFI and then compile your project with it.
- The `LoadedImage` protocol now [exposes the handle](https://docs.rs/uefi/0.4.7/uefi/proto/loaded_image/struct.LoadedImage.html#method.device) for the device where the binary is stored.
- Our CI is now green again! There is [only one test](https://github.com/rust-osdev/uefi-rs/issues/103#issuecomment-604728460) which breaks QEMU, and it's going to stay disabled until it gets fixed.
- Building the repository no longer requires [cargo-xbuild](https://github.com/rust-osdev/cargo-xbuild), we've switched to nightly Cargo's [build-std](https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/cargo/reference/unstable.html#build-std) feature.
- Updated documentation in various places.

## Personal Projects

In this section, we describe updates to personal projects that are not directly related to the `rust-osdev` organization. Feel free to [create a pull request](https://github.com/rust-osdev/homepage/pulls) with the updates of your OS project for the next post.
