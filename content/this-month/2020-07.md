## Project Updates

In this section, we give an overview of notable changes to the projects hosted under the [`rust-osdev`] organization.

[`rust-osdev`]: https://github.com/rust-osdev/about

### [`bootimage`](https://github.com/rust-osdev/bootimage)

The `bootimage` tool allows the creation of bootable disk images for `bootloader`-based kernels. It also provides a runner executable for `cargo` to make `cargo run` and `cargo test` work using QEMU. In July, the crate was updated to work with cargo's own `build-std` feature instead of relying on the `cargo-xbuild` crate:

- [Add support for building bootloaders using `-Zbuild-std`](https://github.com/rust-osdev/bootimage/pull/62) <span class="gray">(published as `v0.8.1`)</span>
- [Make `cargo bootimage` use `cargo build` instead of `cargo xbuild`](https://github.com/rust-osdev/bootimage/pull/63) <span class="gray">(published as `v0.9.0`)</span>

### [`bootloader`](https://github.com/rust-osdev/bootloader)

The [`bootloader` crate](https://github.com/rust-osdev/bootloader) implements a custom Rust-based bootloader for easy loading of 64-bit ELF executables. In July, we switched the crate from `cargo-xbuild` to the `build-std` feature of cargo and fixed a bug that prevented booting in VirtualBox:

- [Change 1st stage int 13h addressing](https://github.com/rust-osdev/bootloader/pull/123) <span class="gray">(published as `v0.9.6`)</span>
- [Make bootloader buildable with `-Zbuild-std`](https://github.com/rust-osdev/bootloader/pull/125) <span class="gray">(published as `v0.9.7`)</span>
- [Enable rlibc dependency only with `binary` feature](https://github.com/rust-osdev/bootloader/pull/126) <span class="gray">(published as `v0.9.8`)</span>

Thanks to [@rsribeiro](https://github.com/rsribeiro) for their contribution!

We also made some progress on adding UEFI support to the bootloader. Our prototype is now able to set up a pixel-based framebuffer, map a given kernel ELF file into virtual memory, and then pass control to its entry point. The next steps are the construction of the boot information structure, including a memory map. You can find a link to the code and the build instructions in [this comment](https://github.com/phil-opp/blog_os/issues/349#issuecomment-663562464).

### [`acpi`](https://github.com/rust-osdev/acpi)

The `acpi` repository contains crates for parsing the ACPI tables – data structures that the firmware of modern computers use to relay information about the hardware to the OS. This month saw some substantial improvements to our AML handling:

- Objects defined by AML tables exist within a namespace, with objects referred to by paths such as `\_SB.PCI0.ISA.COM1`. Until now, we represented this namespace using a `BTreeMap` between the path (allocated on the heap) and a handle to the
object, meaning that there was both a heap-allocated container, and a heap allocation for every single path within the namespace. [In this PR](https://github.com/rust-osdev/acpi/pull/72), we moved the library to use a new representation that has
a `BTreeMap` for each *level* of the namespace. Because each level of the path can only be 4 characters long (`_SB`, `PCI0`, `ISA`, and `COM1` are the *name segments* in the example above), storing the path of each level no longer requires a heap
allocation per object, which reduces the heap-burden of the library significantly.
- Some more opcodes were implemented: `Target`, `DefShiftLeft`, `DefShiftRight`, `DefLOr`, and `DefAnd`. These all appear in QEMU's tables.
- [A fairly large PR](https://github.com/rust-osdev/acpi/pull/73) was merged that provides the ability to traverse the namespace and initialize devices - this is a mechanism that ACPI provides that allows an OS to initialize hardware that it does
not have drivers for, and is a compulsory step in getting modern chipsets to function properly. This required us to build up a lot of functionality, including namespace traversal, reading and writing from *operation regions*, recursively invoking
control methods, and asking the OS to perform hardware configuration for us (such as reading and writing to IO ports and PCI configuration space). There is still a lot of work in getting all of this working robustly, but this is a great start.

### [`uefi-rs`](https://github.com/rust-osdev/uefi-rs)

The `uefi-rs` crate provides safe and performant wrappers for [UEFI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unified_Extensible_Firmware_Interface), the successor to the BIOS.

The major changes which happened in this month are:
- We've tested out support for AArch64. No updates to the code are needed, just [add a custom target file](https://github.com/rust-osdev/uefi-rs/blob/e2748687bdafcc21f35e6d4db27b4b1b31bdcf6e/uefi-test-runner/aarch64-unknown-uefi.json) for 64-bit ARM UEFI and then compile your project with it.
- The `LoadedImage` protocol now [exposes the handle](https://docs.rs/uefi/0.4.7/uefi/proto/loaded_image/struct.LoadedImage.html#method.device) for the device where the binary is stored.
- Our CI is now green again! There is [only one test](https://github.com/rust-osdev/uefi-rs/issues/103#issuecomment-604728460) which breaks QEMU, and it's going to stay disabled until it gets fixed.
- Building the repository no longer requires [cargo-xbuild](https://github.com/rust-osdev/cargo-xbuild), we've switched to nightly Cargo's [build-std](https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/cargo/reference/unstable.html#build-std) feature.
- Updated documentation in various places.

### [`spinning_top`](https://github.com/rust-osdev/spinning_top)

The `spinning_top` crate provides a simple spinlock implementation based on the abstractions of the [`lock_api`](https://docs.rs/lock_api/0.4.1/lock_api/) crate. We created the crate to provide an alternative to the no-longer maintained [`spin`](https://github.com/mvdnes/spin-rs) crate. In July, the crate received the following updates:

- [Implement `try_lock_weak` for use in `lock` loop](https://github.com/rust-osdev/spinning_top/pull/4) <span class="gray">(published as `v0.1.1`)</span>
- [Upgrade `lock_api` to 0.4.0](https://github.com/rust-osdev/spinning_top/pull/3) <span class="gray">(published as `v0.2.0`)</span>
- [Implement `const_spinlock` convenience function](https://github.com/rust-osdev/spinning_top/pull/5) <span class="gray">(published as `v0.2.1`)</span>

Thanks to [@akiekintveld](https://github.com/akiekintveld) for their contributions!

### [`volatile`](https://github.com/rust-osdev/volatile)

The `volatile` crate provides safe wrapper types for implementing volatile read and write operations. The crate received the following changes this month:

- [Derive Default for Volatile, WriteOnly and ReadOnly](https://github.com/rust-osdev/volatile/pull/10) <span class="gray">(published as `v0.2.7`)</span>
- [Remove `Debug` and `Clone` derives for `WriteOnly`](https://github.com/rust-osdev/volatile/pull/12) <span class="gray">(published as `v0.3.0`)</span>

Thanks to [@Freax13](https://github.com/Freax13) for their contributions!

We are also considering a complete rewrite of the crate to wrap references instead of values directly. The main advantage of this is that it makes working with slices possible. See the [pull request](https://github.com/rust-osdev/volatile/pull/13) for details.

### [`cargo-xbuild`](https://github.com/rust-osdev/cargo-xbuild)

The `cargo-xbuild` project provides `cargo` command wrappers to cross-compile the sysroot crates `core` and `alloc`. While there were no updates to the crate itself in July, we added a guide on how to switch from `cargo-xbuild` to cargo's own `build-std` feature to the Readme. You can read it [here](https://github.com/rust-osdev/cargo-xbuild#alternative-the-build-std-feature-of-cargo).

## Personal Projects

In this section, we describe updates to personal projects that are not directly related to the `rust-osdev` organization. Feel free to [create a pull request](https://github.com/rust-osdev/homepage/pulls) with the updates of your OS project for the next post.

### [`IsaacWoods/pebble`](https://github.com/IsaacWoods/pebble)

<span class="gray">(Section written by [@IsaacWoods](https://github.com/IsaacWoods))</span>

Between my work on `acpi` and university commitments, I have not had much time to work on Pebble this month, but
some small clean-ups were made:
- The migration from Travis CI to Github Actions was completed, allowing Pebble to be emulated on CI.
- Pebble uses a HAL (hardware abstraction layer) to separate hardware access from kernel logic. Various parts of the `x86_64` implementation of the HAL were made common to support code-reuse across architectures.
- Some [tests](https://github.com/IsaacWoods/pebble/blob/master/kernel/src/memory/buddy_allocator.rs#L202) were added to the buddy allocator (Pebble's physical memory manager). This was to rule out physical memory
allocation as the cause of a bug where user stacks are occasionally corrupted at the userspace-kernel boundary, which unfortunately has still not been fixed.
- Our [algorithm](https://github.com/IsaacWoods/pebble/blob/master/kernel/hal_x86_64/src/paging.rs#L376-L481) for efficiently mapping arbitrary areas was rewritten and extended to support 1GiB pages.
- Work has started on a *topology layer* - data structures that represent features of the platform such as processors, caches, [NUMA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-uniform_memory_access) nodes, and
microarchitectural information. This will help in allowing Pebble to make more intelligent decisions about scheduling and resource usage in the future.
