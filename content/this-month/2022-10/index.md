[Demilade Sonuga's Blog](https://d-sonuga.netlify.app/) is a new blog on writing a
simple blasterball game with no OS, no engine and minimal external crates. The blog's aim is to take a Rust
beginner from starting the project to finishing it and understanding everything involved in the project's
creation.

The project is still in it's early stages, so lots of feedback is very much needed.

If you're interested, please take a look, and send your thoughts to [@d_sonuga](https://twitter.com/d_sonuga/)
on Twitter.
