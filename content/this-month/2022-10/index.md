<span class="maintainers">Maintained by [@phil-opp](https://github.com/phil-opp) and [@jamesmunns](https://github.com/jamesmunns)</span>

- [Consider regions that lead to very small back paddings as unsuitable](https://github.com/rust-osdev/linked-list-allocator/pull/71)
  - Fixes a potential [memory leak](https://github.com/rust-osdev/linked-list-allocator/issues/66) that was introduced with `v0.10`.
- [Add a random action fuzzer](https://github.com/rust-osdev/linked-list-allocator/pull/69)
  - Runs randomized tests against the `allocate_first_fit`, `deallocate`, and `extend` methods
  - This is the fuzzer that was used to discover the [possible out-of-bounds writes in versions `<=0.10.1`](https://github.com/rust-osdev/linked-list-allocator/security/advisories/GHSA-xg8p-34w2-j49j)
- [Run new cargo-fuzz job on CI with time limit](https://github.com/rust-osdev/linked-list-allocator/pull/72)
  - Fuzzes each commit and PR for 5 minutes as a guard against regressions
  - The CI job is also run on schedule every day to test against the latest Rust nightly and to increase the chance of finding improbably bugs over time.

- [Update `noto-sans-mono-bitmap` to `v0.2.0`](https://github.com/rust-osdev/bootloader/pull/267)
  - now supports more unicode ranges, including the fallback character `ï¿½`
  - code ranges are optional via cargo features to minimize binary size
- [implement read-only relocations](https://github.com/rust-osdev/bootloader/pull/269)
  - implements `GNU_RELRO` program header handling to make relocations read-only
- [allow booting without a UEFI graphics output](https://github.com/rust-osdev/bootloader/pull/268)
  - don't error if no UEFI framebuffer is detected
  - this was merged into the `next` branch for the upcoming `v0.11` release

Thanks to [@phip1611](https://github.com/phip1611), and [@Freax13](https://github.com/Freax13) for their contributions!

### [`acpi`](https://github.com/rust-osdev/acpi)
<span class="maintainers">Maintained by [@IsaacWoods](https://github.com/IsaacWoods)</span>

This month, we began work to remove `acpi`'s dependence on the `alloc` crate for allocations, instead directly
using the [`core::alloc::Allocator`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/beta/core/alloc/trait.Allocator.html) API. This
improves support for bootloaders and kernels that want to treat memory allocation as fallible, allowing them to
more gracefully recover from out-of-memory situations. In the future, we hope that this support will be brought
into `alloc`, so that the library can return to using the standard containers.

These changes are not yet finished or released, but a new major version will likely be out in December with these
changes, as well as better support for PCI topologies with multiple segment groups, and a few other changes. If
you'd like to make use of these new features as they're developed, they're already in `main`, so you can use a Git
dependency.

- [Rework crate to work without allocations](https://github.com/rust-osdev/acpi/pull/131)
- [Add Debug implementations](https://github.com/rust-osdev/acpi/pull/128)

## Other Projects

### [`d-sonuga/blog-blasterball`](https://github.com/d-sonuga/blog-blasterball/)
<span class="maintainers">(Section written by [@d-sonuga](https://github.com/d-sonuga))</span>

[Demilade Sonuga's Blog](https://d-sonuga.netlify.app/) is a new blog on writing a
simple blasterball game with no OS, no engine and minimal external crates. The blog's aim is to take a Rust
beginner from starting the project to finishing it and understanding everything involved in the project's
creation.

The project is still in it's early stages, so lots of feedback is very much needed.

If you're interested, please take a look, and send your thoughts to [@d_sonuga](https://twitter.com/d_sonuga/)

### Talk on Windows Linked Lists in safe and idiomatic Rust
<span class="maintainers">(Section written by [@ColinFinck](https://github.com/ColinFinck))</span>

At the first ever EuroRust conference from 13th to 14th October, Colin Finck gave a talk about the challenges of developing his [`nt-list`](https://github.com/ColinFinck/nt-list) crate.
The crate provides a safe and idiomatic Rust wrapper around the Windows variant of Linked Lists.
It was presented on this blog [in July](/this-month/2022-07/#nt-list-windows-linked-lists-in-idiomatic-rust).

A [recording](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IxhZIyXOIw8) of the talk has just been uploaded.
Check it out, and also check out the [other videos](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCR3gXcme1HMK7_TrUaNZOqw/videos) from that conference for some great takes on Rust!

### [`MaderNoob/galloc`](https://github.com/MaderNoob/galloc)
<span class="maintainers">(Section written by [@phil-opp](https://github.com/phil-opp))</span>

The new [`good_memory_allocator`](https://crates.io/crates/good_memory_allocator) crate implements a `no_std`-compatible linked list allocator, inspired by the [`dlmalloc`](https://gee.cs.oswego.edu/dl/html/malloc.html) algorithm. It stores an additional `usize` of metadata per allocation, which decreases memory efficiency, but increased runtime efficiency. The `README` includes promising [benchmark results](https://github.com/MaderNoob/galloc#benchmarks) that compare the crate against the [`linked-list-allocator`](https://github.com/rust-osdev/linked-list-allocator) and [`simple-chunk-allocator`](https://github.com/phip1611/simple-chunk-allocator) crates.

### [`phil-opp/blog_os`](https://github.com/phil-opp/blog_os)
