The `x86_64` crate provides various abstractions for `x86_64` systems, including wrappers for CPU instructions, access to processor-specific registers, and abstraction types for architecture-specific structures such as page tables and descriptor tables.

We merged the following PRs this month:

- [Ensure that addition and subtraction of addresses panics on overflow/underflow](https://github.com/rust-osdev/x86_64/pull/535)
