## Project Updates

In this section, we give an overview of notable changes to the projects hosted under the [`rust-osdev`] organization.

[`rust-osdev`]: https://github.com/rust-osdev/about

### [`acpi`](https://github.com/rust-osdev/acpi)

The `acpi` repository contains crates for parsing the ACPI tables – data structures that the firmware of modern computers use to relay information about the hardware to the OS.

This month, both the `rsdp` and `acpi` crates saw breaking changes. These changes should require minimal work to migrate to;
please file an issue if you encounter any difficulties. <span class="gray">(published as `rsdp v2.0.0` and `acpi v3.0.0`)</span>

- [Basic support for the MADT's new Multiprocessor Wakeup Structure was added](https://github.com/rust-osdev/acpi/pull/99)
- [`PhysicalMapping` now implements `Send`](https://github.com/rust-osdev/acpi/pull/101)
- [`PhysicalMapping`'s fields were made private, preventing construction of unsound mappings in safe code](https://github.com/rust-osdev/acpi/pull/102).
  The `unmap_physical_region` method of `AcpiHandler` also lost its `self` type - handlers that used `self` should
  instead access themselves through the `PhysicalMapping::handler` method. This prevents a mapping from being
  unmapped using a different handler to the one that mapped it.
- [Accesses to potentially unaligned packed field were fixed](https://github.com/rust-osdev/acpi/commit/d58e64b39e9f22367bc76b64a68826a519615226).
  `repr(packed)` structures are very common in OS Dev, and make sure the layout of Rust's structures matches the
  hardware's. Unfortunately, they can be slightly tricky to work with - creating an unaligned reference is
  undefined behaviour, and references can transiently be created by, for example, calling a method on an unaligned
  field of a packed structure (e.g. `entry.flags.get_bit(4)`). You can read more about this issue [here](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/82523).
- [`acpi::platform` no longer re-exports the contents of its `interrupt` submodule](https://github.com/rust-osdev/acpi/commit/fdd88add32497411d439c2d18fe28258a3fe6525)

### [`x86_64`](https://github.com/rust-osdev/x86_64)

The `x86_64` crate provides various abstractions for `x86_64` systems, including wrappers for CPU instructions, access to processor-specific registers, and abstraction types for architecture-specific structures such as page tables and descriptor tables.

In June, …

### [`uefi-rs`](https://github.com/rust-osdev/uefi-rs)

The `uefi` crate provides safe and performant wrappers for [UEFI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unified_Extensible_Firmware_Interface), the successor to the BIOS. In June, we merged the following changes:

- [Make the `qemu-exit` dependency optional](https://github.com/rust-osdev/uefi-rs/pull/229)
- [Fix type of the media field in the `BlockIO` protocol](https://github.com/rust-osdev/uefi-rs/pull/234)
- [Use `newtype_enum` for `DevicePath` enums](https://github.com/rust-osdev/uefi-rs/pull/230)
- [Make `DevicePath` and `AcpiDevicePath` unaligned](https://github.com/rust-osdev/uefi-rs/pull/231)
- [Derive `Debug` for `CharConversionError`](https://github.com/rust-osdev/uefi-rs/pull/233)
- [Rename boot services' `memset` to `set_mem`](https://github.com/rust-osdev/uefi-rs/pull/235)
- [Implement image loading/starting](https://github.com/rust-osdev/uefi-rs/pull/237)
- [Add `num_blocks` method to `GptPartitionEntry`](https://github.com/rust-osdev/uefi-rs/pull/238)
- [`ShimLock` protocol uses `sysv64` function ABI](https://github.com/rust-osdev/uefi-rs/pull/227)
- [Make using the `stdio` handles require a mutable ref](https://github.com/rust-osdev/uefi-rs/pull/240)
- [Fix AArch64 build](https://github.com/rust-osdev/uefi-rs/pull/243)
