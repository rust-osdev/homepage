### [RavnOS](https://github.com/ShyanJMC/RavnOS)

RanvOS, (from norwegian; raven), is a operative system programmed in Rust. Aims to be; minimal, stable, secure and modern ( this maybe you know as; state-of-art ).

The objective of RavnOS is make an operative system minimalist, self hosted (no external crates, all programmed by me), stable and secure.

- October updates;
   - [Minor code changes to follow good practices](https://github.com/ShyanJMC/RavnOS/commit/048cf546b0488fca9b4dabc2f9b38b6d93e373e1)
- September updates;
   - [ Rune - Added "du" as built-in. Right now is functional but in the future I will add results sorted by size.](https://github.com/ShyanJMC/RavnOS/commit/abc8d639d51b39c712158b9b3a769b88a0b05b66)
   - [ Rune - Now "ls" built-in recognize and show where points the symbolinc link](https://github.com/ShyanJMC/RavnOS/commit/625f2899fa70b6932cbc7899f84f905ebfecd429)
   - [ Rune - Added show as built-in, expanded "info" built-in with more information. Show - Deleted because now is Rune's built-in](https://github.com/ShyanJMC/RavnOS/commit/b8e016d78943f6c64ae1e77072d5dba343268bca)

### [`mkroening/interrupt-mutex`](https://github.com/mkroening/interrupt-mutex)
<span class="maintainers">(Section written by [@mkroening](https://github.com/mkroening))</span>

Building upon [last month's `interrupts` crate](@/this-month/2023-09/index.md#mkroening-interrupts), I created a mutex for sharing data with interrupt handlers or signal handlers.

`RawInterruptMutex` wraps any [`lock_api::RawMutex`](https://docs.rs/lock_api/0.4.10/lock_api/trait.RawMutex.html), be it a [`parking_lot::RawMutex`](https://docs.rs/parking_lot/0.12.1/parking_lot/struct.RawMutex.html) on Unix or a [`spinning_top::RawSpinlock`](https://docs.rs/spinning_top/0.2.5/spinning_top/struct.RawSpinlock.html) on bare metal.
When such an `InterruptMutex` is locked, interrupts are disabled.
When the `InterruptMutex` is unlocked again, the previous interrupt state is restored.
This does not completely rule out deadlocks, since you can just enable interrupts manually when you should not.
Still, it is very convenient to just change the mutex type of data that is shared with interrupt handlers instead of disabling and enabling interrupts manually on every access.

```rust
// Make a mutex of your choice into an `InterruptMutex`.
type InterruptSpinlock<T> = interrupt_mutex::InterruptMutex<spinning_top::RawSpinlock, T>;

static X: InterruptSpinlock<Vec<i32>> = InterruptSpinlock::new(Vec::new());

fn interrupt_handler() {
    X.lock().push(1);
}

let v = X.lock();
// Raise an interrupt
raise_interrupt();
assert_eq!(*v, vec![]);
drop(v);

// The interrupt handler runs

let v = X.lock();
assert_eq!(*v, vec![1]);
drop(v);
```

### [`mkroening/interrupt-ref-cell`](https://github.com/mkroening/interrupt-ref-cell)
<span class="maintainers">(Section written by [@mkroening](https://github.com/mkroening))</span>

Also building upon [last month's `interrupts` crate](@/this-month/2023-09/index.md#mkroening-interrupts), I created a `RefCell` for sharing data with interrupt handlers or signal handlers on the same thread.

On the same thread (software thread or hardware thread (core)), a compiler fence is sufficient for synchronization with signal handlers (on Unix) and interrupt handlers (on bare metal).
In these cases, the new `InterruptRefCell` allows easy sharing without the overhead of mutexes and without the deadlock potential of mutexes.
Similar to `InterruptMutex`, this is helpful for disabling interrupts on accesses but does not protect you from manually enabling interrupts while holding a reference.

```rust
use interrupt_ref_cell::{InterruptRefCell, LocalKeyExt};
 
thread_local! {
    static X: InterruptRefCell<Vec<i32>> = InterruptRefCell::new(Vec::new());
}
 
fn interrupt_handler() {
    X.with_borrow_mut(|v| v.push(1));
}

X.with_borrow(|v| {
    // Raise an interrupt
    raise_interrupt();
    assert_eq!(*v, vec![]);
});
 
// The interrupt handler runs
 
X.with_borrow(|v| assert_eq!(*v, vec![1]));
```
