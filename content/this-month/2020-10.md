## Project Updates

In this section, we give an overview of notable changes to the projects hosted under the [`rust-osdev`] organization.

[`rust-osdev`]: https://github.com/rust-osdev/about

### [`x86_64`](https://github.com/rust-osdev/x86_64)

The `x86_64` crate provides various abstractions for `x86_64` systems, including wrappers for CPU instructions, access to processor-specific registers, and abstraction types for architecture-specific structures such as page tables and descriptor tables.

In October, â€¦

## Personal Projects

In this section, we describe updates to personal projects that are not directly related to the `rust-osdev` organization. Feel free to [create a pull request](https://github.com/rust-osdev/homepage/pulls) with the updates of your OS project for the next post.

<span class="gray">(Section written by [@andre-richter](https://github.com/andre-richter))</span>

The [_Operating System development tutorials in Rust on the Raspberry Pi_](https://github.com/rust-embedded/rust-raspberrypi-OS-tutorials) project now provides [Tutorial 15 - `Virtual Memory Part 2: MMIO Remap`](https://github.com/rust-embedded/rust-raspberrypi-OS-tutorials/tree/master/15_virtual_mem_part2_mmio_remap).

It introduces a first set of changes which are eventually needed for separating `kernel` and `user` address spaces:
- The memory mapping strategy gets more sophisticated and no longer `identity maps` the _whole_ of the board's address space.
- Instead, only ranges that are actually needed are mapped:
    - The `kernel binary` stays `identity mapped` for now.
    - Device `MMIO regions` are remapped lazily to a special virtual address region at the top of the virtual address space during the device driver's `init()`.
