## Project Updates

In this section, we give an overview of notable changes to the projects hosted under the [`rust-osdev`] organization.

### [`x86_64`](https://github.com/rust-osdev/x86_64)

<span class="maintainers">Maintained by [@phil-opp](https://github.com/phil-opp), [@josephlr](https://github.com/orgs/rust-osdev/people/josephlr), [@Freax13](https://github.com/orgs/rust-osdev/people/Freax13), and [@rybot666](https://github.com/orgs/rust-osdev/people/rybot666)</span>

The `x86_64` crate provides various abstractions for `x86_64` systems, including wrappers for CPU instructions, access to processor-specific registers, and abstraction types for architecture-specific structures such as page tables and descriptor tables.

In July, â€¦

### Comparison between [`phip1611/simple-chunk-allocator`](https://github.com/phip1611/simple-chunk-allocator) and [`rust-osdev/linked-list-allocator`](https://github.com/rust-osdev/linked-list-allocator)

In March 2022, Philipp Schuster proposed his [`simple-chunk-allocator`](https://github.com/phip1611/simple-chunk-allocator)
crate. It focuses on being a very simple-to-use general purpose allocator that "just works" for various workloads
in `no_std` context. However, there are other allocators, such as [`rust-osdev/linked-list-allocator`](https://github.com/rust-osdev/linked-list-allocator).
When you choose an allocator, you should not only consider the API and how to set it up, but actually the runtime 
characteristics. OS research has shown us that there is no perfect allocator. You can optimize an allocator for speed,
memory utilization (i.e., prevent fragmentation), code simplicity, and worst case execution time. There exist different
strategies to reach those goals: first-fit, next-fit, best-fit

Recently, Philipp benchmarked his `simple-chunk-allocator` against [`rust-osdev/linked-list-allocator`](https://github.com/rust-osdev/linked-list-allocator) 
to learn under which conditions which performs better. But at first, let's point out some differences. `simple-chunk-allocator` needs 
a static backing storage for heap and an additional static backing storage for its internal bookkeeping. `linked-list-allocator`
can solve this better by organizing the heap with the heap backing memory itself. `simple-chunk-allocator` uses a slightly
adjusted variant of best-fit that tries to reduce fragmentation. `linked-list-allocator` is a first-fit allocator that 
has a lower performance to more heap is used.

The relevant outcome is that `simple-chunk-allocator` always outperforms `linked-list-allocator` in median allocation time.
For stress tests with a low heap consumption, thus, no long stress test with 90% and more heap usage, `simple-chunk-allocator`
also outperforms `linked-list-allocator` in average allocation time. However, if the heap is full and frequent allocations
happen, the average (but not the median) allocation time of `linked-list-allocator` is better. Also, `linked-list-allocator`
can come close to 100% heap usage which is not the case for `simple-chunk-allocator`, because it suffers from internal
fragmentation under certain circumstances. Last but not least, even small allocations always takes up a multiple of the
used chunk size in `simple-chunk-allocator`.

In the end, there is no optimal allocator. You must choose which properties are more relevant for your scenario.
For concrete measurements, please head to the README of [`simple-chunk-allocator`](https://github.com/phip1611/simple-chunk-allocator).
