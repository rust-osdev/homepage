### [`x86_64`](https://github.com/rust-osdev/x86_64)

The `x86_64` crate provides various abstractions for `x86_64` systems, including wrappers for CPU instructions, access to processor-specific registers, and abstraction types for architecture-specific structures such as page tables and descriptor tables.

In September, â€¦

## Personal Projects

### [`andre-richter/qemu-exit`](https://github.com/andre-richter/qemu-exit)

Version `1.0.x` of the crate has been released! 

`qemu-exit` is a crate that allows you quit a running QEMU session with a user-defined exit code. This is useful for `unit` or `integration tests` of bare-metal software (e.g. OS kernels) that are tested in QEMU.

The crate supports the following architectures:
- `AArch64`
- `RISC-V 64`
- `x86_64`

If you want to see the crate in action, you can have a look at how it is used in the [rust-raspberrypi-OS-tutorials project](https://github.com/rust-embedded/rust-raspberrypi-OS-tutorials/tree/master/13_integrated_testing#quitting-qemu-with-user-defined-exit-codes).

Shoutout to [@phil-opp](https://github.com/phil-opp) for inspiring this crate with his original blog post and to [@Skallwar](https://github.com/Skallwar) for his many contributions.
