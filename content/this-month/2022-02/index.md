## Project Updates

In this section, we give an overview of notable changes to the projects hosted under the [`rust-osdev`] organization.

[`rust-osdev`]: https://github.com/rust-osdev/about

### [`x86_64`](https://github.com/rust-osdev/x86_64)

<span class="maintainers">Maintained by [@phil-opp](https://github.com/phil-opp), [@josephlr](https://github.com/orgs/rust-osdev/people/josephlr), [@Freax13](https://github.com/orgs/rust-osdev/people/Freax13), and [@rybot666](https://github.com/orgs/rust-osdev/people/rybot666)</span>

The `x86_64` crate provides various abstractions for `x86_64` systems, including wrappers for CPU instructions, access to processor-specific registers, and abstraction types for architecture-specific structures such as page tables and descriptor tables.

In February, â€¦

### [`uefi-rs`](https://github.com/rust-osdev/uefi-rs)

The `uefi` crate provides safe and performant wrappers for [UEFI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unified_Extensible_Firmware_Interface), the successor to the BIOS.

One of the pain points of developers building software using `uefi-rs` has been the `Completion` type, which is like an expanded `Result` type which also handles warnings (besides successes and errors). There's an [open proposal](https://github.com/rust-osdev/uefi-rs/issues/360#issuecomment-1056004728) to drop this type and revert to using more standard `Result`s everywhere, by treating all warnings as errors. Initial feedback suggests that such a change would be beneficial to the project, but comments and suggestions are welcome on the linked issue.

We merged the following changes in February:

- [Run tests on AArch64 VM in CI](https://github.com/rust-osdev/uefi-rs/pull/353)
- [Add IA32 target to `xtask` and test it in CI](https://github.com/rust-osdev/uefi-rs/pull/354)

- [Update changelog for file info changes](https://github.com/rust-osdev/uefi-rs/pull/373)
- [Make the load options API on `LoadedImage` protocol safer](https://github.com/rust-osdev/uefi-rs/pull/375)
- [Switch all packages to the 2021 edition](https://github.com/rust-osdev/uefi-rs/pull/376)
