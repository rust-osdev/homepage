## Project Updates

In this section, we give an overview of notable changes to the projects hosted under the [`rust-osdev`] organization.

[`rust-osdev`]: https://github.com/rust-osdev/about

### [`x86_64`](https://github.com/rust-osdev/x86_64)

The `x86_64` crate provides various abstractions for `x86_64` systems, including wrappers for CPU instructions, access to processor-specific registers, and abstraction types for architecture-specific structures such as page tables and descriptor tables.

In November, â€¦

### [`metta-systems/vesper`](https://github.com/metta-systems/vesper)

<span class="gray">(Section written by [@berkus](https://github.com/berkus))</span>

Vesper is a capability-based single-address-space exokernel. This means it is aiming to be small, to provide only isolation primitives; at the same time SAS makes it a lot easier to perform cross-process operations (because all addresses are the same across all processes). It uses capabilities to provide security for such operations, so that unauthorized processes will not be able to intervene in legitimate traffic.

It's in very early stages of development and is a basis for a larger envisioned system. The progress is fairly slow, only allowed as my available time permits. This month to motivate me to move it faster I've decided to start posting monthly development updates. The first post is about the tools I use.

Since [rebooting to Rust](https://metta.systems/blog/reboot-to-rust/) almost 4 years ago I've been constantly amazed by the language ecosystem and what wonders are possible. This time I want to tell about incredible tooling that makes my OSdev experience a sunny warm place in contrast to the barren lands of my previous OSdev environments.
