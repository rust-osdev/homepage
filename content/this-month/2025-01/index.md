## Other Projects

In this section, we describe updates to Rust OS projects that are not directly related to the `rust-osdev` organization. Feel free to [create a pull request](https://github.com/rust-osdev/homepage/pulls) with the updates of your OS project for the next post.

### [`roeeshoshani/genesis`](https://github.com/roeeshoshani/genesis)
<span class="maintainers">(Section written by [@roeeshoshani](https://github.com/roeeshoshani))</span>

`genesis` is a bare metal firmware implementation for mips. it implements everything from the bottom up, from
initializing the cpu caches, to configuring pci devices and the interrupt controller.

this month, the core async executor was implemented.

this means that we can implement blocking operations (for example reading a byte from the UART) as rust futures, and we then
`.await` them.

this makes our lives much easier when writing code that needs to block until some I/O events happen. instead of using callbacks,
and having to pass our state all over the place, we can just `.await` the blocking future, and write our code using async functions,
which is much more ergonomic.

##### example

currently, there is only one blocking operation implemented, the operation of reading a byte from the UART.

this allows code like the following to be written:
```rust
loop {
    let byte = uart_read_byte().await;
    println!("received uart byte: {}", byte);
}
```

which is a huge improvement over the previous implementation of putting the code inside the UART interrupt handler.

##### how does it work?

the way this works is that the core kernel's main loop looks roughly like the following:
```rust
loop {
    poll_tasks();
    wait_for_interrupt();
}
```

then, the interrupt handler is responsible for waking up the relevant tasks.

futures that need interrupt handlers to wake them up should somehow register themselves, and the interrupt hanlers will then
wake the registered tasks.

then, in the next iteration, the tasks that were woken up will be polled again, which completes the loop.
