## Project Updates

In this section, we give an overview of notable changes to the projects hosted under the [`rust-osdev`] organization.

[`rust-osdev`]: https://github.com/rust-osdev/about

### [`x86_64`](https://github.com/rust-osdev/x86_64)

The `x86_64` crate provides various abstractions for `x86_64` systems, including wrappers for CPU instructions, access to processor-specific registers, and abstraction types for architecture-specific structures such as page tables and descriptor tables.

In April, we merged the following changes:

- [Added XCR0 register](https://github.com/rust-osdev/x86_64/pull/239) <span class="gray">(published as `v0.13.5`)</span>
- _Breaking:_ [Fixes for x86-interrupt calling convention](https://github.com/rust-osdev/x86_64/pull/242) <span class="gray">(published as `v0.14.0`)</span>
- [Fix some warnings](https://github.com/rust-osdev/x86_64/pull/243)
- [Add `sidt` support](https://github.com/rust-osdev/x86_64/pull/246)
- [Fix `Debug` and `PartialEq` implementations for `IDT` entry type](https://github.com/rust-osdev/x86_64/pull/249)
- [Looser trait bounds for `Port` types](https://github.com/rust-osdev/x86_64/pull/247)

Thanks to [@Luis-Hebendanz](https://github.com/Luis-Hebendanz), [@CraftSpider](https://github.com/CraftSpider), and [@dbeckwith](https://github.com/dbeckwith) for their contributions!

We also prepared a pull request to fix the build on the latest Rust nightlies:

- Use new `const_fn_trait_bound` feature to fix build on latest nightly ([#250](https://github.com/rust-osdev/x86_64/pull/250))

Since `rustfmt` is [currently broken](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/84538) on the affected newer nightlies, many users are still on older nightlies where the `const_fn_trait_bound` feature does not exist yet (`rustup update` skips nightlies where an installed component is missing). For this reason, we decided to wait with merging the fix until the `rustfmt` component is fixed. For people that want to use the latest nightly already, we pre-published the above fix as version `v0.14.1-beta`.

### [`bootloader`](https://github.com/rust-osdev/bootloader)

The `bootloader` crate implements a custom Rust-based bootloader for easy loading of 64-bit ELF executables. This month, we finally merged the UEFI rewrite branch:

- [Rewrite for UEFI support](https://github.com/rust-osdev/bootloader/pull/130) <span class="gray">(published as `v0.10.0`)</span>

This pull request changes the build process completely so that `v0.10.0` is no longer compatible with `v0.9.x` and below. Instead of using the [`bootimage`](https://github.com/rust-osdev/bootimage) crate, it is now recommended to create a custom builder crate. See the [API docs](https://docs.rs/bootloader/0.10.2/bootloader/) for more details. In addition to the build system changes, there are also some API changes such as a new `BootInfo` struct and a different system init state (e.g. a pixel-based framebuffer instead of the VGA text mode). Right now the documentation for the new version is still a bit sparse. We plan to improve this soon, including an update to the [_Writing an OS in Rust_](https://os.phil-opp.com/) blog (see below).

In addition to the UEFI pull request, we merged the following changes this month:

- [Fix documented type for entry point function](https://github.com/rust-osdev/bootloader/pull/147)
- [`llvm_asm!` -> `asm!`](https://github.com/rust-osdev/bootloader/pull/154)
- [Reduce the number of used unstable features of `x86_64` crate](https://github.com/rust-osdev/bootloader/pull/155) <span class="gray">(published as `v0.10.2`)</span>
  - Backported as `v0.9.17` to fix compilation on latest nighlies.

Thanks to [@mkroening](https://github.com/mkroening) and [@CraftSpider](https://github.com/CraftSpider) for their contributions!

### [`xhci`](https://github.com/rust-osdev/xhci)

The `xhci` crate provides types of xHCI structures such as Contexts, Extended Capabilities, Registers, and TRBs.

Previously the repository was hosted under [`@toku-sa-n`](https://github.com/toku-sa-n). Since April, the Rust OSDev team hosts the repository.

This crate is still under depelopment. Some types or field accessors may be missing. If you find missing features, feel free to send a PR!

### [`acpi`](https://github.com/rust-osdev/acpi)

The `acpi` repository contains crates for parsing the ACPI tables â€“ data structures that the firmware of modern computers use to relay information about the hardware to the OS.
This month, we improved diagnostics by recording the original and target AML types in the `AmlError::IncompatibleValueConversion` error. This error is emitted when AML tries to convert a value
to a data type that it can't be interpreted as - AML's rules on possible type conversions and where they can occur are very elaborate, so it helps to know the conversion that was actually attempted.
<span class="gray">(published as `v0.12.0`)</span>

Thanks to [@Knapsac](https://github.com/KnapSac) and [@toothbrush7777777](https://github.com/toothbrush7777777) for their contributions!

### [`ovmf-prebuilt`](https://github.com/rust-osdev/ovmf-prebuilt)

In order to make it easier to run UEFI disk images in [QEMU](https://www.qemu.org/) using [OVMF](https://github.com/tianocore/tianocore.github.io/wiki/OVMF), we created a new `ovmf-prebuilt` project this month. The projects automatically downloads the latest prebuilt OVMF RPM images from [Gerd Hoffman's firmware repository](https://web.archive.org/web/20250505152052/https://www.kraxel.org/repos/) and publishes the extracted `OVMF_*.fd` files as [GitHub releases](https://github.com/rust-osdev/ovmf-prebuilt/releases). A new release is created daily through a CI script. Note that the licensing terms of the [`tianocore/edk2`](https://github.com/tianocore/edk2) repository apply to the released files.

### [`uart_16550`](https://github.com/rust-osdev/uart_16550)

The `uart_16550` crate provides basic support for serial port I/O for 16550-compatible UARTs. In April, we updated the `x86_64` dependency to fix the build on the latest nightlies:

- [Update x86_64 dependency and make it more robust](https://github.com/rust-osdev/uart_16550/pull/14) <span class="gray">(published as `v0.2.13`)</span>

This pull request also minimizes the number of unstable features that are enabled for the `x86_64` dependency to prevent breakage on future `const_fn` changes.

### [`uefi-rs`](https://github.com/rust-osdev/uefi-rs)

The `uefi` crate provides safe and performant wrappers for [UEFI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unified_Extensible_Firmware_Interface), the successor to the BIOS. In April, we merged the following changes:

- [Expose NamedFileProtocolInfo's Header types](https://github.com/rust-osdev/uefi-rs/pull/205)
- [Upgrade to GitHub-native Dependabot](https://github.com/rust-osdev/uefi-rs/pull/207)

Thanks to [@ocadaruma](https://github.com/ocadaruma) for their contribution!

### [`spinning_top`](https://github.com/rust-osdev/spinning_top)

The `spinning_top` crate provides a simple spinlock implementation based on the abstractions of the [`lock_api`](https://docs.rs/lock_api/0.4.1/lock_api/) crate. This month, we fixed a compiler warning:

- [Fix `spin_loop_hint` warning on Rust 1.51](https://github.com/rust-osdev/spinning_top/pull/10) <span class="gray">(published as `v0.2.3`)</span>

### [`cdrzewiecki/celos`](https://gitlab.com/cdrzewiecki/celos)

<span class="gray">(Section written by [@drzewiec](https://github.com/drzewiec))</span>

Over the past couple of months I have made some great strides on my OS.

* Migrated the kernel to the higher half of virtual memory
* Added double fault handling
* Added page fault handling which will attempt to (safely) expand the kernel stack if it overflows
* Related to the above, added more robust frame allocation
* Added basic heap allocation

Still working hard on squashing bugs, adding all of the things above gave me some pretty serious memory allocation bugs and it's taken me a while to get those worked out. I still want to do more testing to make sure I have all the bugs here worked out before moving on.

Next steps will be to get nicer font drawing, and then attempt to implement process support.
