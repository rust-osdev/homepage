## Project Updates

In this section, we give an overview of notable changes to the projects hosted under the [`rust-osdev`] organization.

[`rust-osdev`]: https://github.com/rust-osdev/about

### [`x86_64`](https://github.com/rust-osdev/x86_64)

The `x86_64` crate provides various abstractions for `x86_64` systems, including wrappers for CPU instructions, access to processor-specific registers, and abstraction types for architecture-specific structures such as page tables and descriptor tables.

In April, â€¦

### [`xhci`](https://github.com/rust-osdev/xhci)

The `xhci` crate provides types of xHCI structures such as Contexts, Extended Capabilities, Registers, and TRBs.

Previously the repository was hosted under [`@toku-sa-n`](https://github.com/toku-sa-n). Since April, the Rust OSDev team hosts the repository.

This crate is still under depelopment. Some types or field accessors may be missing. If you find missing features, feel free to send a PR!

### [`uefi-rs`](https://github.com/rust-osdev/uefi-rs)

The `uefi` crate provides safe and performant wrappers for [UEFI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unified_Extensible_Firmware_Interface), the successor to the BIOS. In April, we merged the following changes:

- [Expose NamedFileProtocolInfo's Header types](https://github.com/rust-osdev/uefi-rs/pull/205)
- [Upgrade to GitHub-native Dependabot](https://github.com/rust-osdev/uefi-rs/pull/207)

Thanks to [@ocadaruma](https://github.com/ocadaruma) for their contribution!

Over the past couple of months I have made some great strides on my OS.

* Migrated the kernel to the higher half of virtual memory
* Added double fault handling
* Added page fault handling which will attempt to (safely) expand the kernel stack if it overflows
* Related to the above, added more robust frame allocation
* Added basic heap allocation

Still working hard on squashing bugs, adding all of the things above gave me some pretty serious memory allocation bugs and it's taken me a while to get those worked out. I still want to do more testing to make sure I have all the bugs here worked out before moving on.

Next steps will be to get nicer font drawing, and then attempt to implement process support.
